    <p>Life is a biological concept regarding the characteristics, state, or mode that separates a living thing from dead matter. The word itself may refer to a living being or ongoing processes of which living things are a part of. It may also refer to the period during which something is functional (as between birth and death), the condition of an entity that has been born but yet has to die or that which makes a living thing alive.

      The study of life is called biology, and people who study life are called biologists. A lifespan is the average length of life in a species. Most life on Earth is powered by solar energy, the only known exceptions being the chemosynthetic bacteria living around the hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. All life on Earth is based on the chemistry of carbon compounds, specifically involving long-chain molecules such as proteins and nucleic acid. With water, which is essential, the long molecules are wrapped inside membranes to form cells. This may or may not be true of all possible forms of life in the Universe: it is true of all life on Earth today.Life is a biological concept regarding the characteristics, state, or mode that separates a living thing from dead matter.
